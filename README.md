# Chatbot-Python
This is retrieval based chatbot built using NLTK,keras and python
I used deep learning techniques to build a chatbot for this Python project. The information, which includes intents, patterns, and replies, will be used to train the chatbot. I classified the category to which the user's message belongs using LSTM, and then we randomly selected a response from the list of options.
